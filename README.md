# About The Project 
This back end project is a shopping system where I used the Spring Boot framework to create the application, Maven as dependency management, H2 as the database and memory for testing, and also the Postman tool to test the endpoints. 

The project was structured with logical layers of resource, service, repository, the CRUD system was used and exceptions were handled.
